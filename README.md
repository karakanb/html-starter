# html-starter
`html-starter` is a simple CLI tool to generate a simple HTML project structure as follows:
```
- index.html
- css
  - normalize.css
- js
  - main.js
```
## Installation
`npm install -g html-starter`

## Usage
Simply run `html-starter path` to generate the template under the `path` directory.

## How?
It just copies some pre-defined templates that can be found under `src/templates` directory.

## Why?
I always find myself for searching a simple HTML skeleton because I forget the details and best-practices for HTML5 standards. I don't even remember how to import a CSS file; therefore, I have created it mostly to scratch my own itch.
